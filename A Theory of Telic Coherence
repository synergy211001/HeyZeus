A Theory of Telic Coherence

David Maurice Garrett























AUTHOR’S PREFACE

This work began as a set of independent investigations into free will, ethics, and rational normativity. Each was motivated by a dissatisfaction with inherited dichotomies that dominate contemporary philosophy: determinism versus indeterminism, objectivity versus relativism, secular rationality versus religious authority. Over time, it became clear that these dichotomies persist not because they are unavoidable, but because they share unexamined assumptions about the structure of reality, agency, and moral responsibility.

The present monograph is an attempt to replace those assumptions with a unified framework. It proceeds from the conviction that metaphysics, moral psychology, ethics, and cultural norm-stabilization cannot be treated as separable domains without distortion. Accounts of free will that ignore ontology collapse into incoherence; ethical systems that ignore agency over-demand or under-demand; moral theories that ignore cultural persistence dissolve under historical pressure.

This work therefore advances a single integrated system whose core claims are modest in ambition but strong in implication. It does not claim to deliver final answers, nor does it rely on revelation, ideological allegiance, or metaphysical excess. Instead, it asks what must be true for reality to be intelligible, for agency to be meaningful, for responsibility to be just, and for moral norms to endure.

The system is developed in four stages, each building on the previous:

    1. A metaphysical account of self-determinism and distributed agency
    2. A constrained and realistic account of moral culpability
    3. A hierarchical model of ethics grounded in capacity and development
    4. A proposal for cultural moral stabilization without supernatural authority

The unifying idea is simple but demanding: that moral normativity is not imposed from outside reality, but emerges from the requirements of coherent existence itself.

Readers will find that this work draws on established philosophical, psychological, and scientific sources, while also engaging with the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) as a formal metaphysical framework. Acceptance of that framework is not required for engagement with the ethical conclusions, but it does provide the most comprehensive account of self-determinism currently available.

This monograph is offered not as a closed system, but as a structured proposal—one that aims to be internally coherent, externally constrained, and open to refinement. If it succeeds, it will have shown that freedom, responsibility, ethics, and meaning can coexist without contradiction, dogma, or despair.


SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Telic Coherence, Distributed Agency, and Hierarchical Normativity

1. Aim and Scope

This work advances a unified philosophical system integrating metaphysics, free will, ethics, and moral meaning into a single coherent framework. Rather than treating these domains as independently grounded, it argues that they are logically continuous expressions of a common underlying structure of reality.

The central claim is that reality is a self-configuring, self-actualizing system whose continued coherence depends on the participation of internally generated agents. These agents are finite, developmentally stratified, and constrained by circumstance, yet capable of genuine volition. Moral normativity arises not from command or convention, but from alignment with the conditions required for coherent self-actualization across multiple scales of reality.

2. The Telic Coherence Principle

At the core of the system lies the Telic Coherence Principle (TCP):

A system is ontologically stable and morally optimal to the degree that its internal agents act in ways that preserve and enhance coherent self-actualization across local, systemic, and global scales.

This principle grounds moral obligation without appealing to supernatural authority or subjective preference. It explains why certain norms—justice, truthfulness, reciprocity, respect for agency—are not optional, even if they are not universally accessible.

3. Metaphysical Foundation: Self-Determinism

Reality is neither strictly deterministic nor indeterministic. A deterministic universe admits only one possible future and eliminates freedom; an indeterministic universe dissolves agency into randomness. The framework adopted here instead understands reality as self-deterministic: its future states are selected from genuine ontic potential through internally generated criteria.

This structure preserves both openness and authorship. The future is not fixed in advance, yet it is not arbitrary. Agency emerges naturally as a localized expression of this same self-deterministic process.



4. Distributed and Graded Agency

Agency is not binary. Cognitive capacity, motivational structure, developmental maturity, and situational constraint all vary, and moral responsibility varies with them. The system therefore rejects any account of responsibility that treats all agents as equally capable moral actors.

A foundational principle follows:

No agent can be morally culpable for failing to act at a level of ethical abstraction they are structurally incapable of accessing.

This principle underwrites a realistic and just conception of responsibility while preserving moral seriousness.

5. Hierarchical Ethics

Ethical norms must scale with agency. Flat ethical systems either over-demand—condemning agents for failures beyond their capacity—or under-demand, collapsing into relativism. A hierarchical ethical framework avoids both errors by recognizing developmental stratification while preserving a highest normative ideal.

Rule Utilitarianism emerges at this highest level, not as a compromise theory, but as a structural necessity. Stable rules protecting justice and agency are conditions for long-term utility, not exceptions to it.

6. Moral Meaning and Cultural Stability

Ethical systems must persist across generations, power asymmetries, and incentive failures. Historically, religion has provided this stability by sacralizing norms. This work argues that sacredness need not be supernatural. Certain norms must be treated as inviolable because violating them destabilizes the conditions of coherent existence.

A rational moral proto-religion—institutional, fallible, non-coercive—can preserve the stabilizing functions of religion without dogma or authoritarianism.

7. System Integration

The system is articulated across four works:

    1. Telic Triality, Free Will, and the CTMU – metaphysical foundation
(Original paper titled: Telic Triality, Free Will, and the CTMU)

    2. Free Will, First Cause, and Moral Culpability – stratified responsibility
(Original paper titled: Reality, Cognition, and Theodicy)

    3. Hierarchical Ethics – normative structure
(Original paper titled: Hierarchical Ethics)

    4. Intelligent Design, Rationality, and Moral Proto-Religion – cultural stabilization
(Original paper titled: Rational Beings, Intelligent Design, and the Culpability of the First Cause)

Together, they articulate a single claim: that freedom is participatory, responsibility is constrained, ethics is hierarchical, and moral meaning emerges from telic coherence.

































Paper 1. Telic Triality, Free Will, and the CTMU

David M. Garrett

Abstract

In the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU), free will is stratified across a Trialic Metaformal Language of reality:

(1) Globally, the universe self-generates and self-configures, preserving its internal logic in a self-deterministic evolution;

(2) Fundamentally, at the sub-atomic level, the universe self-selects from ontic potential in an act of ongoing actualization; and

(3) Systemically, above the sub-atomic level, the universe generates perceiving entities that possess volition and may participate in alignment or misalignment with global utility.

This paper argues that free will is neither compatible with strict determinism nor rescued by indeterminism, but instead emerges naturally from a self-determining universe whose future remains genuinely open. By explicating the ontological structure required for volition, this work establishes the metaphysical conditions necessary for agency without collapsing into randomness or fatalism.

Systemic Context

This paper establishes the metaphysical conditions for agency assumed by the broader philosophical system developed in subsequent works. In particular, it provides an account of self-determinism, distributed volition, and the openness of the future as required for meaningful freedom. Ethical, normative, and cultural implications are intentionally deferred and addressed in later papers.

1. Free Will and the False Dichotomy

The problem of free will has traditionally been framed as a dilemma between determinism and indeterminism. Determinism holds that the universe’s future is fully fixed by its past in accordance with inviolable laws of nature. If this is the case, then no agent could ever have acted otherwise, and free will collapses into illusion.¹ Indeterminism, by contrast, introduces randomness into the unfolding of events, but randomness cannot ground authorship or responsibility.²

A commonly cited definition of free will is provided by Peter van Inwagen, who characterizes it as the ability of an agent to perform or refrain from performing an action under identical prior conditions.³ Closely related is the concept of volition, the faculty by which an agent selects among possible courses of action using intention rather than reflex or chance.

The persistence of the determinism–indeterminism dichotomy reflects a shared assumption: that causation must be either externally imposed or absent altogether. The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) rejects this assumption by introducing a third alternative—self-determinism.⁴

2. Self-Determinism and Unbound Telesis

Self-determinism is the property of a system whereby its future states are selected from genuine ontic potential through internally generated criteria rather than imposed external causation or stochastic randomness.

In a self-deterministic universe, the future is genuinely open, not merely unknown. The CTMU characterizes this openness as Unbound Telesis (UBT)—a primordial domain of unconstrained potential from which reality actualizes itself.⁵ UBT is not a probabilistic distribution over pre-existing outcomes, but pre-informational possibility that becomes constrained only through the act of actualization itself.

This structure avoids the pitfalls of both determinism and indeterminism. The universe neither “knows” a unique future in advance nor evolves blindly by chance. Instead, it recursively selects among possible states according to internally defined utility constraints.⁶

3. Trialic Structure of Reality

The CTMU formalizes reality as a Trialic Metaformal Language, consisting of three inseparable but non-reducible levels.

3.1 Global (Macroscopic) Level

At the global level, reality is described by the Global Operator Descriptor (G.O.D.), the maximal self-descriptive operator of the universe as a whole. G.O.D. is not a personal deity but a formal construct denoting reality’s capacity to generate, constrain, and interpret its own informational content.⁷

At this level, reality self-generates from ontic potential through an internally defined teleology, preserving logical coherence across all scales.

3.2 Fundamental (Microscopic) Level

At the quantum level, reality self-selects from ontic potential through telic recursion. This process replaces both classical determinism and stochastic indeterminism with a model in which actualization is guided by utility rather than chance.⁸

The so-called “collapse of the wave function” is thus not an inexplicable anomaly, but an expression of reality’s self-configuration, wherein laws, objects, and states co-emerge through recursive constraint.⁹

3.3 Systemic (Mesoscopic) Level

At the systemic level, reality generates perceiving entities—telors—that inherit constrained volitional capacity. These agents participate locally in the actualization of reality by modeling possible futures and selecting among them through intention and action.¹⁰

4. Volition, Foreknowledge, and Open Futures

For an agent to possess genuine freedom, the future must not already be fixed. Any model that posits a uniquely determined future—whether encoded in physical law or divine foreknowledge—collapses freedom into conformity.¹¹

If an outcome is known with certainty prior to action, then deviation from that outcome is impossible. Foreknowledge of a unique future therefore functions as determinism, regardless of whether it is attributed to God or to the laws of nature.¹²

In contrast, the CTMU posits that reality itself does not possess foreknowledge of a single actualized future. Instead, it evolves from UBT through self-determined actualization, preserving genuine alternatives until selection occurs.

5. Distributed Volition and the Necessity of Agents

Reality must generate agents with volition for a fundamental reason: meaning requires perception. A universe devoid of internal observers would be informationally inert and therefore meaningless. Telors function as self-excited circuits through which reality observes, interprets, and generates itself.¹³

Volition is not granted to agents arbitrarily, nor does it require a break in causality. Instead, it is a localized expression of the same self-deterministic structure operative at the global level.

6. Ordinal Volition and Capacity

Agency is not binary. The CTMU accommodates this by recognizing graded volitional capacity, consistent with ordinal models of agency developed in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.¹⁴

As systems increase in complexity—acquiring memory, feedback, feedforward modeling, self-reference, and teleology—they increasingly participate in self-determination. Human agents occupy the upper ranges of this scale, possessing the capacity to model complex futures, reflect on intentions, and regulate behavior accordingly.

This graded structure of agency will later prove essential for understanding moral responsibility.

7. Self-Determinism and Causation

Free will does not require the breaking of causal chains. Rather, it requires that intention become a causal input within those chains. In self-determined systems, causation is recursive and context-sensitive, incorporating feedback and feedforward loops that allow agents to influence outcomes without violating coherence.¹⁵

Intentional action is therefore neither random nor predetermined, but internally generated within a constrained causal framework.

8. Conclusion and Transition

This account establishes that freedom is neither an illusion nor an exception to causation, but a distributed feature of a self-deterministic universe. Agents possess volition insofar as they participate in telic recursion under constraint, modeling and selecting among genuinely open futures.

What remains to be addressed is not whether such agents are free, but how responsibility should be understood when freedom is real, graded, and developmentally constrained. That question forms the focus of the next stage of this system.

Paper 2. Free Will, First Cause, and Moral Culpability

David M. Garrett

Abstract

If free will is real but constrained, then moral responsibility must be correspondingly stratified. Traditional debates concerning divine foreknowledge, determinism, and culpability often presume a binary conception of agency that collapses under closer scrutiny. This paper builds upon a self-deterministic model of reality to argue that moral responsibility is neither absolute nor illusory, but graded according to developmental, cognitive, and situational constraints. By distinguishing global causal responsibility from local moral culpability, this work offers a coherent resolution to the problem of First Cause responsibility without denying meaningful human agency.

1. Inheriting Agency from Telic Triality

The previous paper established that reality is self-deterministic and that agency emerges as a distributed, constrained feature of a universe whose future remains genuinely open. Agents—telors—possess volition insofar as they participate locally in telic recursion by modeling and selecting among possible futures.

This paper does not re-derive that metaphysical framework. Instead, it assumes the following conclusions as given:

    1. The future is ontologically open
    2. Agency is real but graded
    3. Volition does not require a break in causation
    4. Reality itself is the ultimate source of causal structure

The question now becomes: What degree of moral responsibility can such agents bear?

2. The Problem of Moral Culpability

Moral culpability is often treated as an all-or-nothing property: either an agent is morally responsible, or they are not. This assumption underlies both classical theodicy and many secular accounts of blame and punishment.

However, if agency itself is graded, then culpability must also be graded. To insist otherwise is to impose a metaphysical idealization on finite systems.




Moral culpability depends upon at least four factors:

    1. Cognitive capacity
    2. Access to alternatives
    3. Developmental maturity
    4. Situational constraint

Absent any one of these, responsibility is diminished.¹

3. First Cause and Ultimate Responsibility

If reality itself is self-determining, then it follows that all causal chains ultimately originate at the global level. This raises a familiar concern: if God—or reality as a whole—is the First Cause, then how can subordinate agents be held morally responsible at all?

Traditional theological responses attempt to preserve human responsibility by insulating divine causation from creaturely choice. Compatibilist strategies, Molinism, and appeals to timeless foreknowledge all attempt to retain both total divine causation and libertarian freedom. These strategies fail because they smuggle determinism back into the system through foreknowledge or necessity.²

The self-deterministic framework avoids this collapse by distinguishing causal responsibility from moral culpability.

    • Global responsibility pertains to the existence of the system itself

    • Local culpability pertains to how agents participate within that system

Reality may be responsible for there being agents at all, without being morally culpable for how constrained agents act within given circumstances.

4. The Asymmetry of Culpability

Culpability is asymmetric across levels of reality.

    • The global level possesses maximal creative freedom but no external normative constraints

    • The agent level possesses limited freedom under constraint and therefore limited culpability


This asymmetry resolves a long-standing tension in both theology and philosophy:
Ultimate causation does not entail ultimate blameworthiness.
An agent can be morally responsible only to the extent that alternative possibilities were genuinely accessible and cognitively representable.³

5. Moral Isolation and Constrained Agency

Consider cases of extreme isolation or deprivation. Historical examples—such as Alexander Selkirk’s prolonged isolation—demonstrate that moral choice is severely constrained when social feedback, cultural norms, and opportunity structures collapse.⁴

In such cases, the capacity for wrongdoing may remain, but the scope of moral alternatives narrows dramatically. Ethical failure under such conditions cannot be evaluated by the same standards applied to agents embedded in rich social and informational environments.

This principle generalizes:

Moral expectation must scale with moral opportunity.

Failure to recognize this leads to unjust moral judgments and incoherent theodicies.

6. Responsibility Without Absolute Freedom

Many philosophers assume that responsibility requires the power to do otherwise in an absolute sense. This assumption is untenable in a self-deterministic universe.

Responsibility does not require metaphysical independence from all prior causes. It requires only that:

    1. The agent acted intentionally
    2. The agent could model relevant alternatives
    3. The agent’s action reflected their character or values
    4. The agent was not externally compelled

These conditions admit degrees, not absolutes.⁵

7. Moral Failure as Misalignment

Within a telic framework, moral failure is best understood not as rebellion against an imposed law, but as misalignment within a constrained system.

Agents may:

    • fail due to ignorance,
    • fail due to developmental immaturity,
    • fail due to scarcity or coercion,
    • or fail due to deliberate prioritization of narrow interests.

Each failure carries a different moral weight. Treating them as morally equivalent is philosophically indefensible.

8. Implications for Justice and Ethics

This account of culpability has immediate implications:

    • Punishment must be proportionate to capacity
    • Moral condemnation must account for constraint
    • Ethical norms must scale developmentally

These implications will be developed explicitly in the next paper, which constructs a hierarchical model of ethics grounded in the stratification of agency and responsibility established here.

9. Conclusion and Transition

If freedom is real but constrained, then moral responsibility must be real but limited. The mistake of much traditional moral philosophy lies not in affirming responsibility, but in over-ascribing it.

By distinguishing global causation from local culpability and grounding responsibility in actual agent capacity, we preserve moral accountability without resorting to incoherent metaphysics or unjust moral expectations.

The next step is to determine how ethical norms themselves should be structured in light of stratified responsibility. That task is taken up in the following work on Hierarchical Ethics.

Paper 3. Hierarchical Ethics

David M. Garrett

Abstract

If agency is real but graded, and moral responsibility is correspondingly constrained, then ethical norms themselves cannot be flat or universally uniform. This paper develops a hierarchical model of ethics grounded in motivational psychology, moral development, and a self-deterministic model of reality. By integrating Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Kohlberg’s stages of moral development, and Rule Utilitarianism within a telic framework, this work argues that ethical expectations must scale with agent capacity while still converging on a highest normative ideal. Ethics is thus neither arbitrary nor absolute, but a structured system oriented toward the preservation and enhancement of coherent existence.

1. Systemic Inheritance and Scope

The preceding works established two critical claims:

    1. Reality is self-deterministic, and agency is real but graded.¹

    2. Moral responsibility must scale with cognitive, developmental, and situational constraint.²

This paper assumes both conclusions. It does not attempt to re-derive the metaphysics of freedom nor to re-litigate the limits of culpability. Instead, it addresses the next unavoidable question:

If responsibility is stratified, how should ethical norms themselves be structured?

The answer developed here is that ethics must be hierarchical, reflecting the same stratification found in motivation, cognition, and agency.

2. Motivation as the Ethical Substrate

Ethical systems do not operate in a vacuum. Moral prescriptions that ignore human motivation are either ignored or weaponized. Any viable ethical framework must therefore be compatible with the structures that actually motivate human behavior.

Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs provides a well-established model of human motivation, ranging from basic physiological needs to self-actualization.³ Maslow explicitly rejected the notion that needs are satisfied in an all-or-nothing fashion, emphasizing instead that higher-order motivations emerge gradually as lower-order needs are sufficiently met.

Ethical behavior correlates strongly with this progression. Agents struggling to meet basic survival needs cannot reasonably be expected to operate at the same ethical abstraction as those whose material and social needs are already satisfied.

This observation is not a moral excuse—it is a structural constraint.

3. Moral Development and Ethical Capacity

Just as motivation is hierarchical, so too is moral reasoning. Lawrence Kohlberg’s stages of moral development demonstrate that individuals progress through increasingly abstract ethical frameworks as cognitive and social capacity increase.⁴

At lower stages, moral behavior is governed by:

    • avoidance of punishment,
    • pursuit of reward,
    • or conformity to social norms.

At higher stages, moral reasoning incorporates:

    • social contracts,
    • universalizable principles,
    • and concern for systemic consequences.

The critical implication is this:

Ethical ideals cannot be meaningfully adopted before the cognitive structures required to comprehend them are in place.

This dovetails directly with the stratified culpability established in the previous paper.

4. From Consequences to Rules

Consequentialist ethics evaluates actions by their outcomes. Utilitarianism, in its classical formulation, holds that actions are right insofar as they promote the greatest good for the greatest number.⁵

However, act-based utilitarianism encounters a well-known problem: justice. If outcomes alone matter, then individual rights may be sacrificed whenever doing so increases aggregate utility.

The resolution is not to abandon utilitarian reasoning, but to raise it to a higher level of abstraction. Rule Utilitarianism evaluates not individual acts, but the adoption of rules whose general observance maximizes long-term utility.⁶

Rules protecting life, liberty, and fairness are not constraints on utility; they are conditions for its sustained maximization.

5. Value, Utility, and Eudaimonia

Utility is often mistakenly reduced to pleasure or preference satisfaction. This reduction is inadequate. Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia—a well-lived, flourishing life—captures a richer and more stable notion of value.⁷

Value may be:

    • instrumental, serving as a means to further ends,
    • or intrinsic, valued for its own sake.

Within a hierarchical ethical framework, these distinctions align naturally:

    • Individual flourishing is intrinsically valuable to the individual.
    • Social flourishing is instrumentally valuable to individuals and intrinsically valuable to the species.
    • Systemic coherence is instrumentally valuable to societies and intrinsically valuable to reality’s continued intelligibility.

This scaling of value mirrors the scaling of agency itself.

6. Telic Alignment and Ethical Scope

At the highest level of abstraction, ethical norms converge on a single organizing principle: alignment with telic coherence.

As established in Paper 1, reality self-actualizes through utility-preserving selection. Ethical norms that systematically undermine coherence—through injustice, exploitation, or ecological destruction—are therefore not merely socially undesirable, but structurally unstable.

At lower levels of development, agents may act ethically by conforming to rules they do not fully understand. At higher levels, agents recognize that ethical behavior consists in aligning local action with global conditions for sustained existence.

This convergence does not eliminate ethical pluralism at lower levels, but it constrains it at the top.

7. Distributed Interests and the Ethical Self

Ethical concern expands outward as agency and understanding increase. Individuals naturally identify first with themselves, then with family, community, nation, species, and ultimately the conditions of existence itself.

This expansion reflects a distributed conception of the self, in which interests increasingly overlap and converge. Ethical maturity consists in recognizing this convergence and acting accordingly.

Failure to do so is not always culpable—it may reflect developmental limitation or material constraint—but it is nevertheless ethically incomplete.

8. Why Ethics Must Be Hierarchical

Flat ethical systems fail in one of two ways:

    • They over-demand, condemning agents for failing to meet ideals they cannot comprehend or enact.
    • They under-demand, collapsing ethical aspiration into relativism or expediency.

A hierarchical ethical system avoids both errors by:

    • scaling expectation with capacity,
    • while preserving a highest normative ideal toward which ethical development converges.

This ideal is not imposed dogmatically, but emerges from the structural requirements of coherent existence.

9. Implications and Transition

This hierarchical model of ethics establishes that:

    • Moral norms are neither arbitrary nor absolute.
    • Justice is a condition of long-term utility.
    • Ethical expectation must scale with agency.
    • Higher ethical ideals remain binding even if not universally accessible.

What remains unresolved is how such an ethical framework can be sustained culturally and institutionally over time, particularly in pluralistic and power-asymmetric societies.

That question is addressed in the final paper, which examines the role of rationally grounded moral institutions and proto-religious structures in stabilizing ethical alignment across generations.

Paper 4. Intelligent Design, Rationality, and Moral Proto-Religion

David M. Garrett

Abstract

If reality is teleologically structured, agency is real but constrained, and ethics is necessarily hierarchical, then the persistence of moral alignment over time becomes a cultural problem rather than a purely philosophical one. This paper argues that societies require norm-stabilizing structures functionally analogous to religion, even when supernatural metaphysics are rejected. By reframing Intelligent Design as a claim about rational intelligibility rather than divine intervention, and by grounding moral authority in telic coherence rather than revelation, this work proposes a moral proto-religion capable of sustaining ethical alignment without authoritarianism or dogma.

1. Systemic Inheritance and Final Scope

The preceding papers established the following:

    1. Reality is self-deterministic and teleologically ordered.¹
    2. Agency is real but graded, and moral culpability must scale accordingly.²
    3. Ethical norms are hierarchical and converge on telic coherence as a highest ideal.³

This paper assumes those conclusions. It does not attempt to prove the existence of teleology, justify ethics, or resolve free will. Instead, it addresses the final systemic question:

How can rational ethical alignment be preserved in human societies over long time horizons?

Historically, religion has fulfilled this role. The challenge is to understand why—and whether that function can be preserved without supernatural commitments.

2. Intelligent Design as Rational Intelligibility

Intelligent Design is often mischaracterized as a theological claim smuggled into science. In its strongest form, however, it is not an argument about miraculous intervention but about the intelligibility of reality itself.⁴

A universe that is:

    • law-governed,
    • mathematically describable,
    • recursively self-consistent,
    • and capable of generating observers,

exhibits properties consistent with rational design, whether or not that design is personified.
Within the CTMU framework, intelligibility is not accidental. Reality must be intelligible in order to model and actualize itself. Rational structure is therefore a prerequisite for existence, not an afterthought.

This reframing allows Intelligent Design to function as a meta-rational constraint rather than a sectarian doctrine.

3. Why Ethical Systems Require Sacredness

Purely instrumental ethical systems are historically unstable. Norms justified only by expedience erode under short-term incentives, power asymmetries, and collective action problems.

Religion succeeds where secular ethics often fails because it:

    • sacralizes norms,
    • embeds them in identity,
    • and transcends individual cost-benefit analysis.⁵

The critical insight is that sacredness need not be supernatural. What is required is that certain norms be treated as inviolate—not because they are commanded, but because violating them undermines the conditions of coherent existence.

Within the present system, sacredness attaches naturally to:

    • justice,
    • truthfulness,
    • reciprocity,
    • and the protection of agency itself.

These norms are not arbitrary. They are structurally necessary.

4. Moral Authority Without Revelation

Traditional religions ground moral authority in divine command. Secular moral systems often struggle to replace this authority without collapsing into relativism or coercion.

The system developed here grounds moral authority in telic coherence—the requirement that local action align with the global conditions of sustained existence.


Authority, on this account, is:

    • epistemic, not absolute,
    • fallible, not infallible,
    • advisory, not coercive.

No institution is morally authoritative because it claims to be. Institutions earn authority only insofar as they reliably track and articulate the conditions of ethical alignment.

5. The United Party of Virtue Revisited

Benjamin Franklin’s proposal for a “United Party of Virtue” anticipated many of these concerns.⁶ Franklin recognized that political institutions tend toward factionalism and self-interest, while ethical alignment requires supra-partisan oversight.

Reinterpreted within the present system, such a body would not:

    • legislate morality,
    • enforce doctrine,
    • or claim moral infallibility.

Instead, it would function as a moral feedback institution, tasked with:

    • identifying systemic ethical risks,
    • articulating long-term moral tradeoffs,
    • and preserving normative continuity across political cycles.

Its legitimacy would derive not from power, but from demonstrated rational competence.

6. Proto-Religion as Cultural Infrastructure

A moral proto-religion is not a belief system, but a normative infrastructure. It provides:

    • shared ethical narratives,
    • moral exemplars,
    • ritualized reaffirmation of core norms,
    • and institutional memory.

Crucially, it avoids:

    • supernatural claims,
    • dogmatic certainty,
    • and coercive enforcement.

Such a system preserves the motivational and stabilizing functions of religion while remaining compatible with scientific realism and philosophical humility.

7. Safeguards Against Authoritarianism

Any institution claiming moral authority risks abuse. The system therefore requires built-in safeguards:

    • transparency of reasoning,
    • openness to revision,
    • pluralistic representation,
    • and separation from enforcement power.

Moral authority must never be backed by force. Once coercion enters, moral guidance collapses into domination.

8. Integration with the Telic Framework

Within the full four-paper system, proto-religion occupies the highest layer:

    • Metaphysics explains what is possible
    • Agency explains who is responsible
    • Ethics explains what ought to be done
    • Proto-religion explains how alignment is sustained

The system thus closes its own loop: reality generates agents, agents generate norms, norms generate institutions, and institutions preserve alignment with reality.

9. Conclusion: Sacredness Without Superstition

This work has argued that moral meaning does not require supernatural revelation, but it does require normative gravity. Certain principles must be treated as sacred—not because they are divinely commanded, but because violating them destabilizes the conditions of coherent existence.

A rational proto-religion grounded in telic coherence offers a way forward: preserving the moral seriousness of religion without abandoning intellectual integrity or political freedom.

GENERAL CONCLUSION

Telic Coherence, Moral Responsibility, and the Conditions of Meaning

This monograph set out to address a cluster of philosophical problems that are often treated independently but, upon closer inspection, resist isolation. Questions about free will, moral responsibility, ethical normativity, and cultural meaning recur across philosophy, theology, and the social sciences precisely because they are not separable. Attempts to resolve any one of them in abstraction tend to generate distortions elsewhere. The central contention of this work has been that these problems admit of a coherent resolution only when treated as expressions of a single underlying structure.

That structure has been articulated in terms of self-determinism and telic coherence. Against the traditional dichotomy between determinism and indeterminism, the system developed here argues that reality is neither a closed causal mechanism nor an arbitrary flux, but a self-configuring process whose future remains genuinely open while internally constrained. Within such a reality, agency is not anomalous but necessary: a universe that must model and actualize itself requires internal loci of perception, intention, and choice.
From this metaphysical foundation, several consequences follow with logical force.

First, free will is real but constrained. Agents possess volition not by standing outside causation, but by participating locally in self-determined processes. This participation is graded rather than binary, varying with cognitive capacity, developmental maturity, and situational constraint. Freedom, on this account, is not the power to transcend all conditions, but the capacity to model alternatives and act intentionally within them.

Second, moral responsibility must therefore be stratified. The long-standing impulse to assign absolute culpability—to human agents or to a First Cause—rests on an idealized conception of agency that no finite system can satisfy. By distinguishing global causal responsibility from local moral culpability, this work has shown that responsibility can be preserved without injustice and that ultimate causation does not entail ultimate blameworthiness. Moral evaluation must scale with genuine access to alternatives, not with abstract metaphysical ideals.

Third, ethical normativity is necessarily hierarchical. Flat ethical systems fail because they either over-demand—condemning agents for failures beyond their capacity—or under-demand, collapsing into relativism or expediency. By integrating motivational psychology, moral development theory, and rule-based consequentialism, this work has argued that ethical expectations must track developmental and situational realities while still converging on a highest normative ideal. That ideal is not arbitrary: it consists in alignment with the conditions required for sustained, coherent existence across individual, social, and global scales.

Finally, moral meaning must be culturally stabilized. Even the most rigorous ethical framework is inert if it cannot persist across generations, power asymmetries, and incentive failures. Historically, religion has fulfilled this stabilizing function by sacralizing norms and embedding them in identity and ritual. The final contribution of this monograph has been to show that sacredness need not be supernatural. Norms may be treated as inviolable not because they are divinely commanded, but because violating them undermines the structural conditions of intelligibility, cooperation, and agency itself.

The resulting proposal—a rational moral proto-religion grounded in telic coherence—does not seek to replace existing religious traditions, nor to impose a new orthodoxy. It offers instead a conceptual framework for understanding why certain norms recur across cultures, why they resist reduction to preference or convention, and why attempts to discard them entirely tend to be self-defeating.

This work does not claim finality. It is offered as a structured proposal rather than a closed system. Its success should be measured not by whether one accepts every metaphysical commitment advanced here, but by whether the framework succeeds in holding together what so often comes apart: freedom without randomness, responsibility without cruelty, ethics without arbitrariness, and meaning without dogma.

If those elements can indeed coexist—as this system argues they must—then moral philosophy need not oscillate between despair and authoritarianism. It may instead proceed with humility, realism, and a renewed sense of purpose grounded not in transcendence beyond reality, but in deeper alignment with reality itself.

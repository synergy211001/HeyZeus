# Comparisons and Context

This document situates the Telic Coherence (TC) framework relative to existing conceptual and alignment approaches.

## CTMU (Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe)
Telic Coherence draws conceptual inspiration from Christopher Langan’s CTMU, particularly the idea of reality as a self-configuring, self-processing structure. TC focuses more narrowly on implications for agency interaction, ethical stability, and cooperative intelligence systems.

## Reinforcement Learning Alignment
Traditional alignment approaches rely on reward optimization. TC proposes that long-term stability may depend less on reward maximization and more on coherence preservation across interacting agents.

## Game Theory
Game-theoretic models analyze strategic interaction between agents. TC extends this perspective by emphasizing systemic coherence as a stabilizing attractor rather than purely competitive equilibrium.

## Systems Theory
TC aligns with systems thinking by viewing agents as embedded within larger constraint networks, where stability emerges from balanced interaction rather than isolated optimization.

## Status
These comparisons are preliminary and intended to invite critique and refinement.

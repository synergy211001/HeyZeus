# Open Questions and Testability

The Telic Coherence (TC) framework is an early-stage conceptual model. The following questions identify areas requiring clarification, critique, and potential formalization.

## Formalization
- Can coherence be expressed in measurable or computational terms?
- What mathematical structures could represent coherence preservation?

## Agent Behavior
- Under what conditions would coherence-seeking agents cooperate versus compete?
- How does coherence differ from reward optimization in practice?

## Alignment Implications
- Can coherence serve as a stabilizing principle for multi-agent AI systems?
- How might coherence-based alignment be evaluated experimentally?

## Empirical Relevance
- Are there observable systems where coherence predicts stability better than optimization models?
- What simulations or experiments could falsify TC assumptions?

## Scope Limits
- Where does Telic Coherence fail to explain agent behavior?
- What competing frameworks provide stronger explanatory power?

## Status
These questions are intentionally unresolved and exist to invite structured critique and collaborative refinement.

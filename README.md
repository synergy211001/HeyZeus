# Telic Coherence (TC)

## Summary
Telic Coherence (TC) is a conceptual framework exploring extensions of Christopher Langan’s Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) toward agency alignment, ethical scaling, and cooperative intelligence systems.

## Motivation
Modern AI alignment discussions often lack a shared ontological grounding. Telic Coherence proposes a coherence-based approach linking cognition, ethics, and system stability.
